# Overview

Simple Vein Miner introduces a vanilla-friendly mechanic that allows players to instantly mine groups of adjacent blocks, saving nothing more than precious time. Groups of ores, large trees, vast crop fields, and more. Each tool can have its own configurable block list allowing for limitless possibilities. This is a fantastic perk for Prison, Factions and Semi-Vanilla servers that isn't overpowered but still gives players a rewarding benefit for donating to your server.

## Features In Brief:
- Efficient mining of similar blocks in quick succession
- Powerful configuration for custom tool categories and block lists
- A variety of mining patterns to mine cubic regions, tunnels, or staircases
- Optional economy support
- Optional client-sided mod for custom keybinds
- A developer API for custom mining patterns and behaviors
- Drag-and-drop installation with no additional steps for server owners by default
- Native Anti Cheat and PlaceholderAPI support

## Client Companion Mod (Currently incompatible with Folia version of plugin)

The companion mod is an optional client-sided mod to provide a more rich user-experience for players including support for custom keybinds, keybinds for pattern switching, and vein mining wire frame rendering. This can be downloaded and installed for Fabric clients.

# Supported Anti Cheats

Simple Vein Miner natively supports many popular anti cheats so that your players will not be flagged with "fast break" (or whatever the equivalent flag is for your anti cheat of choice). If the anti cheat you are using is not listed here, there is a high chance that players using vein miner will be false flagged for breaking blocks too quickly. If you want another anti cheat added to this list, please request it be supported either in the Discussion Thread, on Discord, or on GitHub as an issue.

- AntiAura
- FoxAddition (via their plugin)
- Grim Anti Cheat 2.3.59+
- LightAntiCheat
- Matrix 6.x+
- Negativity
- NoCheatPlus
- Spartan
- Themis
- Vulcan
  - Vulcan has a config option to enable the API, which is disabled by default. enable-api must be true

Simple Vein Miner happily supports PlaceholderAPI with the following placeholders:

- `"%veinminer_enabled%"`  
  Whether or not VeinMiner is toggled on.

- `"%veinminer_enabled_<category>%"`  
  Whether or not VeinMiner is toggled on for a given category.

- `"%veinminer_active%"`  
  Whether or not VeinMiner is active (e.g. the player has the keybind pressed).

- `"%veinminer_vein_mining%"`  
  `"true"` or `"false"` depending on whether or not the player is currently vein mining.  
  Only `"true"` for a brief moment in time.

- `"%veinminer_vein_mineable%"`  
  Provides `"true"` if the player's target block is vein mineable with the tool in hand, or `"false"` otherwise.  
  Requires player.

- `"%veinminer_vein_mineable_<category>%"`  
  Provides `"true"` if the player's target block is vein mineable with the specified category, or `"false"` otherwise.  
  Requires player.

- `"%veinminer_using_client_mod%"`  
  `"true"` or `"false"` depending on whether or not the player is using the client mod.

  The name of the player's selected method of activation (`"Sneak"`, `"Client"`, `"Always"`, etc.).

- `"%veinminer_category%"`  
  Provides the name of the category of the tool in the player's hand.  
  Requires player.

- `"%veinminer_cost%"`  
  Provides the cost of vein mining.  
  - If a player is specified, provides the cost of the tool in the player's main hand (or the globally configured cost if no category is in hand), accounting for the `"free economy"` permission.  
  - If a player is **not** specified, provides the globally configured cost.

- `"%veinminer_cost_<category>%"`  
  Provides the cost of vein mining for the specified category.  
  - If a player is specified, accounts for the `"free economy"` permission.

  Provides the max vein size of the specified category.


# Messaging Protocol

Simple Vein Miner communicates with the Minecraft client via its [custom payload packet](https://wiki.vg/Protocol#Plugin_Message_.28clientbound.29). While VeinMiner does have its own client-sided companion mod, other client mods are capable of listening to these channels and intercepting messages. Additionally, while VeinMiner supplies API to communicate with the client, servers also have the option of listening to the raw message contents.
